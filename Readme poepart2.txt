# Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot

This is a C# console-based chatbot designed to simulate a conversational assistant that provides cybersecurity advice. The project was developed as part of a programming assignment to demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming, delegates, interface abstraction, conversation flow, and sentiment detection.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ Task 1: Basic Chatbot Structure
- Greets the user by name
- Provides a looping conversation system
- Exits cleanly with a farewell message

### ✅ Task 2: Keyword Recognition with Delegates
- Uses a `ResponseDelegate` to separate chatbot logic
- Detects keywords like **password**, **phishing**, **malware**, and more
- Each keyword has multiple predefined responses for variety

### ✅ Task 3: Improved Conversation Flow
- Implements a simple state tracker using `enum`
- Enhances conversation flow to make interactions more natural

### ✅ Task 4: Logging and User Profile
- Stores user details such as name
- Logs each conversation entry to a file
- Tracks session duration and keywords used

### ✅ Task 5: Sentiment Detection
- Identifies emotions like **curious**, **worried**, **frustrated**, and **confused**
- Returns empathetic responses from a `List<string>` based on detected sentiment

### ✅ Task 6: (Optional / Future Expansion)
- Could include question prediction, natural language processing, or basic learning ability
